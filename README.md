# Mesh-Editor
This project is a 3D mesh editor built in C++ and OpenGL. It allows users to load, view, and manipulate 3D models. The editor is built around a **half-edge data structure**, which enables efficient traversal and modification of the mesh geometry. The application also supports loading and binding a skeleton to the mesh for basic animation.
